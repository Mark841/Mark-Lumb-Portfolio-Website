          <div class="collcontent">
            <p>I have an understanding of multiple programming languages, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>Assembly Language</li>
				<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap, RedBean, Twig</li>
				<li>C, C# and C++</li>
				<li>SQL</li>
				<li>Linux Command Line Interface</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With one of my Python projects I used a library called PyGame which has entirely different and new commands inside it which I had to use almost entirely for the coding of snake and its AI. I researched and taught myself how to use this new part of the language from scratch.</p>

          <!-- Collapsibles for Troubleshooting -->
          <button class="collapsible">Adaptability</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
            <p>I am quick to adapt to new technologies and languages when I am introduced to them. In one of my projects 
				in 2017 I had to learn SQL to construct a database to store information about users. I had to teach myself 
				what I needed to know in the space of 2 weeks, which by the end of that period of time, I had coded a database 
				that was used to store: a users’ username, score, the moves they took during the game and more. Since going to 
				university, I have adapted and learnt more languages including Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Testing and debugging</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
            <p>Since starting programming, I have always done testing and debugging of programs as it is almost inevitable, 
				however my method for testing and debugging has grown substantially since I started. I would originally put print 
				statements in and try and figure out where something has gone wrong as I wouldn’t be able to understand the error 
				that was returned to me. Now I can do a variety of methods for testing and debugging, including understanding the 
				returned error or exception statements, using the debug menu in my Java IDE or even using JUnit.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">GUI Design and Implementation</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
				<p>I have experience with creating and designing GUI’s as I have created several in a couple of programming languages. 
				No matter what language I program a GUI in, I always start by thinking how I want the interface to look and appear, 
				what buttons will do what, where the buttons and everything on the window should be, colour of the window, etc. 
				When implementing a GUI in a project I will sometimes have to edit the methods I have already made to make them 
				more friendly for a GUI, such as if a method returns a Boolean, but it has multiple places where it returns. Then 
				when I implement it in a GUI, I may make it return a string which explains what happened and this string can then 
				be used to provide more options or information to the user from the GUI. I believe this makes the GUI more effective 
				as it provides the user with more information.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Leadership</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
				<p>I have had lots of times where I have demonstrated leadership and communication skills. An example of this is 
				in a group project, where me and two others took control of a group to try and steer them towards completing a goal 
				that we had been set. We organised times for the group to meet up at to discuss the work, we also tried to increase 
				the moral and team spirit when we thought or suspected it was dropping.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Problem Solving</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
				<p>My problem-solving skills have substantially developed over the recent years, allowing me to become both better 
				in programming and developing, as well as in everyday life. In programming I have learnt how to more efficiently solve 
				a problem or error, or increase the performance and run-time of a program by using more efficient techniques. In 
				development, my problem solving helps me to solve problems that were similar to previous ones I have had before.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Planning and Organisation</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
				<p>My planning and organisation skills have developed since I went to university, where before when I was given a 
				project -or started my own project- I would just go about it and complete it before the deadline for the project was 
				due. Now when I get given a project, I plan it out and create a time management timetable that allocates what part of 
				the project I will try to complete each day and set mini deadlines for myself (such as finishing a class) which I will 
				try to keep on top of, to keep me on track for the final project deadline.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Web Design</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
				<p>Since going to University, I have learnt how to create a website and how the design of the website is very important 
				in enticing the user to stay on the site, it is not as important as the content staying relevant but still quite 
				important. Because of this, when I start to create a website I will get an idea of how I want it to look and plan it 
				out on paper to get a visual idea of what it looks like (very similar to the design process I use for a GUI).</p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Logic</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
				<p>I am skilled in applying logic to situations, this is very useful in programming as it allows me to follow how a computer 
				would process the code that has been written. This also allows me to break down a problem repeatedly until I have it in 
				terms of how a computer will be able to process it and then I can code that broken-down version of the problem.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Independance</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
                <p>I am quite capable of programming independently, as well as collaboratively with others. All of the examples in the work section so far have been written entirely by me. If I am in a project and I don’t know how to 
				program the thing I need to do next, I will go away research it and learn how to do it. I will then come back to it and 
				use what I have learnt to program it, I don’t need to rely on others to help me fix the problem.</p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">Attention to Detail</button>
          <div class="collcontent">
				<p>I like paying attention to the details of my programs, this means when I make a program that asks for inputs it will 
				validate to see if the user’s input is valid, for example if it asks for a string for someone’s name, but the user enters 
				a blank string I won’t allow a blank string it must be of a certain length before it is allowed. I also don’t like doing 
				a job not to the highest standard that I can do it too, unless it has been specified that I should do it to a certain way, 
				I will always try and improve my code to make it the best I know I can make it.</p>
