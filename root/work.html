        <p>In my time at <b><a href="https://www.treves-group.com/en">Treves UK</a></b> I worked in multiple different areas and jobs to try and expand my knowledge and skill set.

                <li>There was a waste bag suspended from the roof which when full proved difficult for employees to take down as it got very heavy, I came up with a solution to make it easier and less time consuming to do so</li>
                <li>Made a more efficient working triangle for an employee (so they wouldn’t have to move around as much to do all of their tasks), I did this by combining existing workbenches in a more efficient space</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Enhanced existing workbenches into new ones to make a more efficient working triangle for an employee, so they wouldn't have to move around as much to do all their tasks making them more efficient.</li>

        <p><b><a href="http://www.technotherm.co.uk/">Technotherm Ltd</a></b> is an international company that sells ring binder mechanisms and other products. Working in a small team of 2 staff, I had to work under pressure when lots of orders came in, in a small time. While working their I had to locate products in the warehouse, package them either on pallets or in boxes and send them to customers. In a short space of time I had to learn how to use the companies software and computer system to take orders, make invoices for customers and make delivery notes for the delivery/shipping companies.</p>

This taught me independence, time management and perseverance as it would be in all weather conditions throughout the year and in the early morning. For a couple of weeks I would also get up to help unload a delivery truck into the shop, these occurred at 4am which improved on my ability to manage time.</p>
